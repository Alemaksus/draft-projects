/*
 * WHILE LOOP:
 * Each store employee makes $15 an hour. Write a program that allows the employee
 * to enter the number of hours worked for the week. Do not allow overtime.
 *
 * Key Points of While Loop:
 * Itâ€™s controlled by a condition and will continue to run while that condition remains true.
 * The condition is tested before the loop is entered, so there's a chance that this loop will never execute.
 * It's good to use the While loop when you may or may not need to run the loop, based on the state of the condition.
 *
 * Steps of While Loop:
 * First the condition is evaluated to determine if the loop needs to be executed.
 * If that's true, the statements inside of the loop are executed.
 * Then the condition is rechecked to determine if to run the loop again.
 *
 * Remember to update the sentinel inside your loop.
